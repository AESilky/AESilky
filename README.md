- 👋 Hi, I’m Ed (@AESilky)
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics w/μControllers&SBC using AI+vision, software, electronics, metalwork/machining, and Morse code.
- 🌱 I work mostly in C, C++, and Python, though sometimes other languages come into play. I made a living with Java, C, C++, and C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Mars style robotic rover (have other robots, including a TurtleBot3).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Retro Style Z80 Single Board Computer (to let me use my ICE).
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on robotics, retro-computing, and Morse.
